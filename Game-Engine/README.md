# Java Game Engine 

A game engine prototype developed in Java. This was developed as practice to make a relative complete 2D game.
This project contains 2 Minigame prototypes, the first one is a sorting game where you have to put the correct 
item in their respective place, in the second one you control a player that has to dodge a square that act's
like an enemy.
