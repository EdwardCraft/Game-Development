# Multiplayer
In this project I'm experimenting and learning on how does a multiplayer works. For the server side, I use node.js with 
express.js and Libgdx for the game engine. For disclaimer is not really a game much more a simulation, you control a 
player that moves forward and backwards.

## Getting Started
You can either clone or download the repository. 

### Prerequisites
+ node version 4.2.6 or higher
+ gradle version 2.11 or higher
+ Any text editor of your choosing

### Running the tests

+ Before you start an instance of the game you have to run the server locally, in the project directory there's a 
folder name "server" , once you there,  in the command line type "node index". 
+ In the command line type "gradle build" this will compile the project and generate a jar in the build/libs directory
+ Run the jar , this will create an  instance of the game and when you run the same jar again , this will create another 
instance or another player.
